# Credit Risk Scorecard – Logistic Regression Model

Overview

This project builds a credit risk classification model using logistic regression: project is derived from by tradtional bank scorecard modeling practices.

The objective is to predict the PD(probablity of default) using behavioral and demographic features.

The workflow follows regulated finance standards:

1. Data Understanding  
2. Feature Engineering  
3. Logistic Regression Modeling  
4. Model Validation (AUC, Gini, KS....)  
5. Interpretation of Risk Drivers

Dataset 

UCI Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset  
- 30,000 observations  
- Behavioral repayment variables  
- Credit exposure variables  
- Binary default target  

---

Model Approach

Model Type: Logistic Regression  
Features Used:
- credit limit capped
- Age
- deliquent-sept

Scaling applied for numerical stability.

Model Performance

| Metric |        Value |
|--------|--------------|
| AUC |           0.72 |
| Gini |          0.44 |
| KS Statistic | ~0.38 |

DEmosntrating strong discriminatory power for a baseline model.

 Key Risk Drivers

-Delinquency in September -Strong positive effect on default probability  
Credit Limit- Higher limit associated with lower risk  
Age-- Small positive impact
